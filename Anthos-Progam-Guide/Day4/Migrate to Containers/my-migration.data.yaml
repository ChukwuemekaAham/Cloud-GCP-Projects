## Data volumes for data migration.
## Each volume can either refer an existing PVC in the processing cluster, or contain a spec for a new PVC to be created.
## The list of folders in each entry get copied to the PVCs root.
## Here's an example:
##
#volumes:
#- deploymentPvcName: some-pvc
#  existingPvc:
#    name: my-pvc
#  folders:
#  - /bin
#  - /opt
#- deploymentPvcName: some-new-pvc
#  folders:
#  - /etc
#  newPvc:
#    spec:
#      accessModes:
#      - ReadWriteOnce
#      resources:
#        requests:
#          storage: 10G
